STATUS: PASSED ✓

WHY ENSEMBLE LEARNING?
- Combines diverse architectures (ResNet, EfficientNet, ConvNeXt)
- Reduces individual model biases
- More robust predictions through voting
- Industry-standard technique for competitions

KEY INSIGHTS:
- Different architectures make different mistakes
- Ensemble corrects individual model errors
- Majority voting is simple but effective
- Model diversity is key to ensemble success

TECHNIQUES DEMONSTRATED ACROSS ALL LEVELS:
✓ Level 1: Transfer learning (ResNet50)
✓ Level 2: Advanced augmentation (Mixup, CutMix, TTA)
✓ Level 3: Custom architecture exploration (EfficientNet-B2)
✓ Level 4: Ensemble learning (3-model voting)
